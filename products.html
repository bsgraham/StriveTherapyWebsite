							<h3>Build Your Own Practice (BYOP)</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							Opening a private practice can be scary.
							Many mental health professionals spend their internships (and maybe part of their paid career) at community mental health agencies. Most graduate schools focus on creating the best mental health clinicians (i.e. they discuss human development, therapy modalities/theories, etc.). But, nowhere along the way are you taught about the business side of therapy. 
							I’m here to change that. 
							I graduated in December of 2020, launched my practice in March of 2021, and now have a thriving, 100% virtual private practice. I’m here to show you that it is possible to make the leap from grad school (or CMH) to private practice. You can do it, you can be successful, and earn what you're worth. 
							So, if you’re a mental health practitioner who’s ready to make the leap, then this course is for you.

										<div class="disclosureHeader">Build Your Own Practice Disclosure Statement</div>
										<br>
										Hello and welcome! I’m glad that you’re here and I’m so excited for you to grow on your professional journey. In this document, I’m going to share a little information about my background, what’s included in this presentation, and the limitations of this presentation. 
										<br>

										<div class="disclosureHeader">Experience</div>

										I’m Brittany Graham (she/her/hers) and I’m a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist Associate (#MG.61139743) in the state of Washington. I’m also a pre-clinical fellow with the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT).

										I’ve worked in the mental health field since 2017 with most of my experience coming from community mental health (CMH). In 2020, I graduated from Antioch University with a Masters in Marriage and Family Therapy. Like most of us, I quickly became tired and burnt out from my agency job. In January of 2021, I began looking into private practice, group practice, or anything that would get me out of CMH. 

										In March of 2021, I took the leap and jumped into the world of business ownership and private practice! I spent months learning everything on the business side (all the stuff they don’t teach you in grad school) and had some great mentors along the way. This was A LOT of time consuming, grueling, but fun, work. 

										Today, I am thriving in private practice. The transition from CMH to business ownership has been scary, confusing, and exhilarating. I’m so honored and happy to be able to share this information with you. 
										<br>
