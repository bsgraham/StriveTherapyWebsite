						<h2>Welcome</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Hello and welcome to Strive Therapy, I’m glad you’re here. At Strive Therapy, I believe that you hold the power to heal yourself and live your best possible life. 
						But maybe, you need a little help to access that power. Sometimes our past hinders us from unlocking our full potential. Maybe you’ve experienced trauma, a life transition, 
						or are living with anxiety or depression. I hear you and can help. With your life expertise and my clinical knowledge, we can work together to help you move forward 
						in a meaningful and lasting way.</p>
					<p>
						Therapy is hard work. It requires time, emotional labor, and change. Therefore, you need to go through this therapeutic journey with someone you trust. 
						Please explore my website, learn more about me, my services, and style of therapy. If I seem like a good fit, reach out. I’d love to work with you!

							<p>
								Individuals ages 12 to 18 are in a difficult phase of their lives. They have less agency than adults, but are often told to act like an adult and shouldered with heavy responsibilities. 
								At Strive Therapy, you’ll have a safe place to decompress while you learn about yourself, your strengths, and how to manage stress.

								<h3>Family Therapy</h3>

							</div>
							<p>
								Family Therapy involves working with children (ages 6+) or teens and their caregivers who are facing distress due to school issues, family conflict, or life transitions. 
								As the behaviors and moods of one individual can be felt throughout a family, family therapy is highly recommended and has been proven effective in alleviating these issues and more.

								Sometimes, we need to focus on ourselves. Adult psychotherapy is for any individual, aged 18+, who’s looking to take a deep dive in self-exploration to foster change. 
								You’ll learn more about yourself, your relationships, and how to move forward.
