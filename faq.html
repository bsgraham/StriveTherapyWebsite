							<h3>What are your fees?</h3>
							</p>Our first session, called an intake, is billed at $250 for 80 minutes. Subsequent sessions last 50 minutes and are billed at $200 for individuals and
								$225 for families. A session is considered a family session when two or more individuals join for 25+ minutes.
							</p>
							You have the right to receive a “Good Faith Estimate” explaining how much your mental health care will cost.

									<p>You have the right to receive a “Good Faith Estimate” explaining how much your mental health care will cost.</p>

									<p>Under this law, healthcare providers must provide clients who don't have or are not utilizing insurance an estimate of the expected charges for psychotherapy services.</p>

									<p>You have the right to receive a Good Faith Estimate for the total expected cost of any non-emergency healthcare services, including psychotherapy services.</p>

									<p>You can ask your healthcare provider, and any other provider you choose, for a Good Faith Estimate before you schedule a service.</p>

									<p>If you receive a bill that is at least $400 more than your Good Faith Estimate, you can dispute the bill. Make sure to save a copy or picture of your Good Faith Estimate.</p>

									<p>For questions or more information about your right to a Good Faith Estimate, visit <a href="https://www.cms.gov/nosurprises" target="_blank">www.cms.gov/nosurprises</a>.</p>	

							<h3>Do you offer a sliding scale?</h3>
							</p>Yes!I offer reduced-fee therapeutic services through Open Path Psychotherapy Collective. Through this organization, I charge $70 for individual 
							sessions and $80 for family sessions. Please know that I have limited availability for reduced fee clients/families. Visit 
							my professional profile at <a href="https://openpathcollective.org/clinicians/brittany-graham/" target="_blank">Open Path Psychotherapy Collective</a> 
							to learn more and see if I’m accepting reduced-fee clients. 
							
							</p>

							
							<h3>Do you accept insurance?</h3>
							</p>I provide all clients with superbills, which are sent directly through the client portal. Superbills lists all sessions attended within the month as well 
								as my practice information and your diagnosis. As a fully licensed therapist, I find that most of my clients are successful in receiving at least partial
								reimbursement for their sessions, once they submit superbills.
							</p>
							<p>I am not paneled directly with insurance providers and fees are billed at the time of service. 
							</p>
							
							<h3>How can I use my out-of-network benefits? What questions should I ask my insurance provider?</h3>
							</p>Superbills will be your friend! This should be the one piece of documentation you’ll need to submit to your insurance provider each month to be eligible
								for out-of-network reimbursement.
							</p>
							<p>Before starting therapy, I’d also recommend reaching out to your insurance provider directly and asking the following:
								<table class="contactTable">
									<tr class="tableRowUnderline">
										<td>What are my benefits when seeing an out-of-network provider?</td>
									</tr>
									<tr class="tableRowUnderline">
										<td>Will I have a copay or deductible to meet before insurance kicks in?</td>
									</tr>
									<tr class="tableRowUnderline">
										<td>How do I submit superbills?</td>
									</tr>
									<tr class="tableRowUnderline">
										<td>Do I need a referral from my primary care doctor before starting services?</td>
								</tr>
							</table>

							<h3>What is a mental health diagnosis and do I need one?</h3>
							</p>Mental health professionals use a standardized manual to help us classify the symptoms our clients experience. This provides us with a diagnosis, and the
								diagnosis tells us how to best treat our clients. As an example, if you’re diagnosed with anxiety, a therapist might use CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy)
								with you, rather than another therapy model that has been proven less effective.
							</p>
							<p>Diagnoses are also critical when utilizing insurance. Many health insurance providers will only cover mental health expenses when you have a diagnosis. 
							</p>
							
							<h3>What will our first few sessions look like?</h3>
							</p>Our first meeting will be an intake session. It’ll last approximately 80 minutes and will help me gain a better understanding of who you are and your reasons
								for coming to therapy. It'll also be the jumping off point for determining if you meet criteria for a mental health diagnosis. After intake, we’ll spend
								some time creating goals and getting to know one another before the real work begins.
							</p>
							
							<h3>How often will we meet?</h3>
							</p>Therapy has been proven to be the most effective when engaged in regularly, meaning that weekly sessions are vital to your success. As you move through the
								therapeutic process, we can discuss tapering down your sessions to help you have a smooth transition as therapy ends. 
							</p>
							
							<h3>How long will I be in therapy?</h3>
							</p>My job is to work myself out of a job. Meaning, I want to help my clients accomplish their goals and feel ready to take on the world without me. In our first
								few sessions, we’ll set goals and create a treatment plan. Every few months we’ll check-in about these goals, measure progress, and create new goals 
								(if needed). These check-ins will give us a better understanding of how you’re reaching goals and when you might be ready to end therapy.
							</p>
							
							<h3>Do you prescribe medication?</h3>
							</p>Masters level clinicians such as myself cannot prescribe medication. I can, however, help you get connected to a doctor, psychiatric nurse, or psychiatrist.
							</p>
							
							<h3>How can therapy help?</h3>
							</p>Good therapy is transformative. It can help you gain insight into who you are and live more authentically. You might find greater self-confidence, boundary
								setting skills, and a deeper connection with yourself and others. You’ll walk away feeling more in-tune with who you are while also having gained practical
								skills to continue your success. 
							</p>
							
							<h3>How do I book an appointment?</h3>
							<p>Before we jump into things, let’s make sure we’re a good fit! I offer one free 15-minute phone consultation for this purpose. You’ll get a sense of who I am 
								as a therapist and have a chance to ask any unanswered questions. I’ll have a moment to assess your situation and describe how I can offer support. You 
								can book this consultation directly by clicking the “client portal” button in the upper right hand corner of your screen, or you can send me an email by 
								scrolling down to the bottom of this page and filling out the “get in touch” section.
