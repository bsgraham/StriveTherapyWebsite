							Life can be hard. It’s full of changes, beginnings, endings, and at times may be confusing. At Strive Therapy, I hear you and want to help. 
							That’s why I offer individual and family therapy sessions. In my opinion, therapy is best served regularly. I’d like to see you or your family 
							weekly, for 50 minutes.

							<h3>Family Therapy</h3>
						</header>
						<p>Have you ever noticed how a challenge that one family member is facing, affects the whole household? Or how one member’s problems, behavior, 
							or mood impacts others? Through systems thinking, I understand that all members of a family (either chosen, through blood, or marriage) rely 
							on and impact others. Because of this, family therapy is highly recommended for many challenges and especially with children. Family therapy 
							can help with:

							<h3>Individual Therapy</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							Living with anxiety can be exhausting—whether it's constant worry, racing thoughts, or feeling overwhelmed by everyday life. I’m here to help you navigate
							through that, working together to understand the root of your anxiety, develop practical tools, and bring a sense of calm and balance back into your life. 
							We’ll explore the things that trigger your anxiety and build confidence, so you can start feeling more at peace.
						<p>
							While anxiety is my specialty, I also enjoy working with members of the LGBTQIA+ community, helping people who are moving through life changes, dealing with
							depression, struggling with self-worth, or facing challenges within their family. Whatever you're working through, I’m here to support you with understanding,
							compassion, and the tools to help you 
							move forward.

							<h3>Types of Therapy</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							For successful therapy, having a collaborative, therapeutic relationship is key. Because of this, I draw from several different 
							therapeutic models, using a blend that fits you best. Overall, my services are strength-based and person-centered. I draw from 
							the following therapeutic models:

							<table class="contactTable">
									<tr class="tableRowUnderline">
										<td>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):
										<p>Our thoughts can sometimes trick us or make life feel harder than it needs to be. Together, we’ll figure out which
											ones are holding you back and practice new ways of thinking that help you move forward.
										</td>
									</tr>
									<tr class="tableRowUnderline">
										<td>Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT):
										<p>When emotions feel like a rollercoaster, DBT gives you tools to slow things down. I’ll help you learn how to calm your
											body, understand your feelings, and make choices you feel good about.
										</td>
									</tr>
									<tr class="tableRowUnderline">
										<td>Emotionally Focused Family Therapy (EFFT):
										<p>Sometimes big feelings lead to big misunderstandings. I help families learn to talk through emotions in a way that 
											builds trust, strengthens connection, and helps everyone feel seen and supported—especially during tough moments.
