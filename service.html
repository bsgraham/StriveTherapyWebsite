						<p> 
							Life is hard. It’s full of changes, beginnings, and endings, and at times, is confusing. At Strive Therapy, I hear you and want to help. That’s why I offer individual and family therapy sessions. In my opinion, therapy is best served regularly. I’d like to see you or your family weekly, for 50 to 75 minutes. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Please note that due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, all of my services will be conducted via a secure video call.

							<h3>Family Therapy</h3>
							<p>
								Have you ever noticed how a challenge that one family member is facing, affects the whole household? Or how one member’s problems, behavior, or mood impacts others? Through systems thinking, I understand that all members of a family (either chosen, through blood, or marriage) rely on and impact others. Because of this, family therapy is highly recommended for many challenges and especially with children. Family therapy can help with: 
	Behavioral issues		School problems		Life transitions
	Anxiety			Depression			Stress
	Family conflict		Parenting			Self-esteem 
							</p>

							<h3>Individual Therapy</h3>
							<p>
								Sometimes, life gives us lemons. It tosses us curveballs, derails our plans, and throws us off track. Through individual therapy, I’ll help you make lemonade. Together, we’ll pick you up, do some realignments and figure out how to move forward. Individual therapy can help with: 
	Anxiety			Depression			Stress
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)		Self-harm
Self-esteem		Suicidality			Life transitions
Peer relations		Trauma			Behavioral issues
Grief				Relationships		Family conflict
Issues specific to the LGBTQ+ community	Emotion regulation

I have a special interest in working with teens and young people. As a baby-faced millennial, I know how difficult it can be growing up in our current world. I also know that society/adults/people in general, place a lot of pressure on folks in this age range. Although I can’t necessarily alleviate this pressure, I do enjoy empowering young people, teaching them how to cope, and providing them with a safe space. 
							</p>

							<h3>Types of Therapy</h3>
							<p>
								For successful therapy, having a collaborative, therapeutic relationship is key. 
Because of this, I draw from several different therapeutic models, using whichever model fits you best. Overall, my services are strength-based and  person-centered. I draw from the following therapy models:
Structural Family Therapy			Solution Focused Therapy
Emotion Focused Therapy			Therapeutic Play
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)		Humanistic Therapy
							</p>

							<h3>Fees</h3>
							<p>
								
I do not currently accept insurance. I can, however, provide you with a superbill which you may submit to your insurance for out-of-network reimbursement. Please note, that many health insurance providers only reimburse a portion of therapy fees. Check with your insurance to learn more about your mental health coverage and benefits. 

I accept all major credit and debit cards (including Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover) through my secure client portal. Payment is due at the time of service. 

Individual: 50 minutes at $130 or 75 minutes at $150
Families: 50 minutes at $150 or 75 minutes at $175
Intake: $175 
							</p>

							<h3>Sliding Scale</h3>
							<p>
								I offer reduced fee therapeutic services through Open Path Psychotherapy Collective. Through this organization, I charge $60 for individual sessions and $80 for family sessions. Please know that I have limited availability for reduced fee clients/families on my caseload. Visit my professional profile at ____________ to see if I’m accepting reduced fee clients and to learn more.
