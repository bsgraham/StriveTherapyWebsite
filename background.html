					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p>
						I come from a mixed culture family. My mom is Guatemalan and my dad is White. Both of my parents served in the military, so I've lived in a few different states.
						 Washington however, is my home. In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my two cool dogs, eating/cooking good food, and hiking.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a cis, het, White passing individual, I have privilege. Based on my identity, my life experiences may greatly differ from yours. Because of this, I know that 
						you’re the expert of your own life. You know yourself, your identity, your culture, better than I ever could. Aside from being a woman, I can never fully understand 
						what it's like to be a part of a marginalized population. </p>
					<p>
						Because of my identity, I know that I might not be the right therapist for everyone. As a human being, you deserve to feel safe, heard, and respected, regardless of 
						who you enter a therapeutic relationship with. I strive to support and serve as an ally for those belonging to marginalized populations, including, but not limited 
						to: BIPOC and LGBTQ+.
