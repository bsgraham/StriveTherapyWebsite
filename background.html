								<h3>Education</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								I received my Bachelor’s of Science degree in psychology from Washington State University and my Master’s of Art degree in marriage and family therapy from Antioch 
								University, Seattle.
							</p>
							<p>
								As a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, I am required to attend continuing education courses. This helps me stay relevant, practice ethically, and serve
								my clients.
							</p>
							<header>
								<h3>Experience</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								I’ve worked in the mental health field since 2017. Before that, I worked at a childcare center. I have experience working in both inpatient and outpatient settings, 
								community mental health agencies, schools, hospitals, and jails. Before attaining my therapy license, I served as a case manager and crisis response specialist.

									<h3>About Me</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									I come from a mixed culture family. My mom is Guatemalan and my dad is White. Both of my parents served in the military, so I've lived in a few different states.
									 Washington, however, is my home. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my sweet family, eating/cooking good food, and hiking.
								</p>
								<p>
									As a cis, het, White passing individual, I have privilege. Based on my identity, my life experiences may greatly differ from yours. Because of this, I know that 
									you’re the expert of your own life. You know yourself, your identity, and your culture better than I ever could. Aside from being a woman, I can never fully understand 
									what it's like to be a part of a marginalized population.
								</p>
								<p>
									Because of my identity, I know that I might not be the right therapist for everyone. As a human being, you deserve to feel safe, heard, and respected, regardless of 
									who you enter a therapeutic relationship with. I strive to support and serve as an ally for those belonging to marginalized populations including, but not limited 
									to, BIPOC and LGBTQ+. 
								</p>

						<h3>The Why</h3>
						<p>I’ve always wanted to help people understand themselves better—and because I know how challenging life can be at different stages. Growing up in today’s world comes with its own set of 
							pressures, especially for teens and young adults. As a baby-faced millennial, I can relate to how overwhelming that can feel. I specialize in working with preteens, teens, and young
							adults (ages 11-26) because this age range is so often misunderstood. Teens are often seen as moody or rebellious, but really, they’re navigating a time of growth and change. Young 
							adults are dealing with their own set of transitions—college, jobs, relationships—and that can feel confusing too. My goal is to be the therapist I wish I had when I was younger, 
							offering a safe space where you can feel heard, understood, and empowered to manage whatever life throws your way.</p>
